## Feature Engineering

## 1st Method: Feature Filters

## Correlation Coefficients #####################
##library(help = "stats")
plot(data$LotArea, data$SalePrice, col="red", xlab="Year Built", ylab="Sales Price", main="Pearson Correlation")

cor(x=data$LotArea, y = data$SalePrice, use="everything", method="pearson")
## 0.2638434
## a lose positive correlation w/ LotArea & Sale Price as I would expect

cor.test(x=data$LotArea, y =data$SalePrice)
## P value is very small so the null hypothese that the true correlation of 
## is equal to zero can be rejected.

## NOTE: Keep in mind to look at other correlation measures such as spearman or kendall
pairs(data)
##Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large

## Mutual Information #######################

## Calculates how important the inclusion/exclusion of
## a variable is in predicting a correct class.

## Compared to Correlation: not limited to linear dependencies,
## uses probability distribution.

##install.packages("FSelector")
library(FSelector)
##Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME='C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_231') # for 32-bit 
ig_values <-information.gain(SalePrice~.,data)
ig_values

## filter top K features

top_k_features <- cutoff.k(ig_values,2)
f<- as.simple.formula(top_k_features,"SalePrice")
f
## SalePrice ~ Neighborhood + MSSubClass
## Seems reasonable but I'm a bit skeptical when other
## features are formatted in a way that makes sense to these algoithms.
## Perhaps it doesn't matter as much if it's doing something similar to what
## the decision tree does and just tries to select the variables that 'splits'
## the dataset more clearly in regards to the target variable.

## 2nd Method: Wrapper Method

## errors below are for the reg.data... 
## kept getting errors w/ reg data I think b/c
## of some steps in my preprocessing data so I'll
## have to go back to that... switched to mtcars
## data set to keep going w/ assignment


## Forward Selection
## : Start w/ a feature set of one feature and sequentially
##   add the next best feature & update the model to reveiew
##   performance.

## Backward Selection
## : Reverse of Forward Method, start w/ all features and then
##   remove least performing features one by one while updating
##   the model.


## Backward Selection

library(caret)
rfe_controller <- rfeControl(functions = lmFuncs, method="repeatedcv", repeats = 5, verbose = FALSE)
size <- c(1:10)

##names(reg.data) Help me find indices
data("mtcars")
lm_Profiler <- rfe(x=data[,1:12], y=data[,13], sizes=size,rfeControl = rfe_controller)
lm_Profiler

data[,1:12]
data[,13]
##Error in { : 
##task 1 failed - "contrasts can be applied only to factors with 2 or more levels"
lm_Profiler

plot(lm_Profiler)

## Feature Extraction or Construction
range(data$LotArea)
scale(data$LotArea)

## Dimensionality Reduction
##PCA
## doesn't like my factors? Need to figure
## out how to scale them.
sale_price_features <- data[3:4]
sale_price_target <- data[13]

sale_price_pca <- prcomp(x=sale_price_features, scale. = T)
biplot(sale_price_pca,scale = TRUE, pc.biplot = TRUE)

##Linear Discriminant Analysis
##LDA finds linear combinations of features
##that also accounts for the classes of the data


data(iris)
head(iris)
train<-sample(1:150,75)
library(MASS)
lda_model <- lda(Species~., data=iris, subset=train)
lda_model$means

##Predictions on the test data
lda_pred <- predict(object=lda_model, newdata = iris[-train,])
lda_pred$class
iris_test <- iris[-train, ]
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_point(aes(lda_pred$x[,1], lda_pred$x[,2], colour = iris_test$Species, shape = iris_test$Species), 
                      size = 2.5) + ggtitle("Linear Discriminant Analysis") + xlab("LDA1") + ylab("LDA2") + labs(fill = "Species")

## Embedded Methods
library(randomForest)
mtcars.rf <- randomForest(mpg ~., data=mtcars, ntree=1000, keep.forest=FALSE, importance=TRUE)
importance(mtcars.rf)
importance(mtcars.rf, type=1)

return (data)
